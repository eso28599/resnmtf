Description: The package provides functions for performing ResNMTF on multi-view data. ResNMTF is a multi-view biclustering approach based on non-negative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF) which allows for overlapping and non-exhaustive biclusters. It is a flexible approach which allows for any combination of restrictions betweeen views e.g. shared rows between 1st and 2nd views, shared columns between 1st and 3rd views, etc.
