# ResNMTF

Welcome to the landing page for the `resnmtf` package implementing
Restrictive Non-Negative Matrix Tri-Factorisation (ResNMTF) from the
paper “Multi-view biclustering via non-negative matrix
tri-factorisation”.

ResNMTF is a flexible method which allows for any combination of shared
rows and/or columns between views. For example, if view 1 and 2 share
columns and views 1, 3 and 4 share rows, as in the following figure,
this can be incorporated.

![Illustration of views with shared rows and
columns.](reference/figures/shared_rows_cols.png)

It does this by approximating the data matrix for each view $X^{(v)}$ by
the factorisation $F^{(v)}S^{(v)}\left( G^{(v)} \right)^{T}$, as in the
following image (for 3 views with shared rows):

factorisations.](reference/figures/resnmtf_figure.png)

## Installation

You can install this R package using the following line of code:

    devtools::install_github("eso28599/resnmtf") # requires devtools package to be installed

**Important:** This package benefits from the speed ups provided by
using a non-“reference” version of BLAS (a library to perform standard
mathematical operations). It’s really easy to use a quicker version, see
[here](https://higgicd.github.io/posts/accelerating_r/) for an example.

## Usage

To demonstrate the use of `resnmtf` we generate toy data with 2 views
and 3 biclusters, assuming biclusters share rows across views, but do
not share columns. View 1 has dimensions $100 \times 50$ and view 2,
$100 \times 30$.

    row_clusters <- cbind(
      rbinom(100, 1, 0.5),
      rbinom(100, 1, 0.5),
      rbinom(100, 1, 0.5)
    )
    col_clusters_v1 <- cbind(
      rbinom(50, 1, 0.4),
      rbinom(50, 1, 0.4),
      rbinom(50, 1, 0.4)
    )
    col_clusters_v2 <- cbind(
      rbinom(30, 1, 0.4),
      rbinom(30, 1, 0.4),
      rbinom(30, 1, 0.4)
    )
    data <- list(
      row_clusters %*% diag(c(5, 5, 5)) %*% t(col_clusters_v2) +
        abs(matrix(rnorm(100 * 50), 100, 50)),
      row_clusters %*% diag(c(5, 5, 5)) %*% t(col_clusters_v2) +
        abs(0.01 * matrix(rnorm(100 * 30), 100, 30))
    )

### Application

The `apply_resnmtf` function is used to obtain biclusters. It takes as
input multi-view data in the form of a list i.e. the data
$X = \{ X^{(1)},\ldots,X^{(n_{v})}\}$ should be inputted as a list
`list(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n_v)`.

The desired restrictions are imposed via restriction matrices `phi`,
`psi` and `xi` which enforce shared row clusters, column clusters and
row-column matching respectively.

    phi <- matrix(0, 2, 2)
    phi[1, 2] <- 1 # regularises towards shared rows between view 1 and view 2
    phi_val <- 200 # hyperparameter chosen to enforce regularisation
    results <- apply_resnmtf(data, phi = phi_val * phi)

If the number of biclusters present in each view are known, this can be
supplied via `k_vec`:

    results <- apply_resnmtf(data, k_vec = rep(3, 2), phi = phi_val * phi)

If instead you would like to change the range of biclusters considered
initially ($3 \leq k \leq 8$ by default), this can be implented via the
`k_min` and `k_max` inputs:

    results <- apply_resnmtf(data, k_min = 4, k_max = 10, phi = phi_val * phi)

Notes:

- a non-zero `xi` restriction matrix also enforces the assumption that
  the scale of the biclusters is equal across views.
- the number of biclusters does not need to be specified, but will be
  determined by the bisilhouette score.

### Results

The multi-view biclustering is contained within two lists defining the
row and column clusters associated with the biclusters. For a specific
view, both are represented via binary logic matrices, with the
$(i,j)^{th}$ element equal to $1$ if row/column $i$ belongs to bicluster
$j$, and $0$ otherwise.

    results$row_clusters
    results$col_clusters

I.e. for the given example, `results$row_clusters` is a list of length
2, the first element of which is a binary matrix of size $100 \times k$
where $k$ is the number of biclusters found.

### Single-view data

The method can also be applied on single-view data, inputted either as a
list containing the matrix of the single-view:

    data <- list(
      row_clusters %*% diag(c(5, 5, 5)) %*% t(col_clusters_v2) +
        abs(matrix(rnorm(100 * 50), 100, 50))
        )
    results <- apply_resnmtf(data)

Or as a matrix:

    data <- row_clusters %*% diag(c(5, 5, 5)) %*% t(col_clusters_v2) +
              abs(matrix(rnorm(100 * 50), 100, 50))
    results <- apply_resnmtf(data)
